Ejercicio
create height and weight vectors of 5 people
```{r}
height <- c(152,173,168,153,170)
weight <- c(103,139,140,160,160)
```
create vector gender that stores the sex of the 5 people
```{r}
gender <- c("Female","Male","Male","Female","Male")
```
create a data frame with height, weight and gender
```{r}
infodf <- data.frame(height,weight,gender)
infodf
```
change the gender column of the df to a factor
order the gender as female, male
```{r}
gender_factor <- factor(gender)
levels(gender_factor) <- c("Female","Male")
gender_factor
positions<-order(infodf$gender)
infodf[positions,]
infodf[,"gender"]
```
